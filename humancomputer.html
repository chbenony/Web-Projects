Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson (born August 26, 1918) is an African American physicist and mathematician who made contributions to the United States' aeronautics and space programs with the early application of digital electronic computers at NASA. Known for accuracy in computerized celestial navigation, she conducted technical work at NASA that spanned decades. During this time, she calculated the trajectories, launch windows, and emergency back-up return paths for many flights from Project Mercury, including the early NASA missions of John Glenn and Alan Shepard, and the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon, through the Space Shuttle program Her calculations were critical to the success of these missions. Johnson also did calculations for plans for a mission to Mars.

<h2>Here's a timeline of Katherine Johnson's Life: </h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Katherine Coleman was born in 1918, to Joshua and Joylette Coleman in White Sulphur Springs, Greenbrier County, West Virginia.</li>

    <li>In 1939, Coleman became the first African-American woman to desegregate the graduate school at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West VA.</li>
    <li>In 1953, she was offered a job at NASA.</li>
    <li>From 1953 through 1958, Johnson worked as a "computer", analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the West Area Computers section supervised by mathematician Dorothy Vaughan, Johnson was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division.</li>
    <li>In keeping with state racial segregation laws, and federal workplace segregation introduced under President Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century, Johnson and the other African-American women in the computing pool were required to work, eat, and use restrooms that were separate from those of their white peers.</li>
    <li>rom 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during her career to the Spacecraft Controls Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the May 5, 1961 space flight of Alan Shepard, the first American in space.</li>
    <li>She calculated the trajectory for the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.</li>
    <li>In 2015, President Barrack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her contribution to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).</li>
  </ul>
